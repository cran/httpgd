A graphics device for R that is accessible via network protocols.
This package was created to make it easier to embed live R graphics in 
integrated development environments and other applications.
The included HTML/JavaScript client (plot viewer) aims to provide a better overall user experience when dealing with R graphics.
The device asynchronously serves graphics via HTTP and WebSockets.

## Features

* Fast plotting
* Plot resizing and history
* Interactive plot viewer (client)
* Platform independent
* Export to various image formats (SVG, PNG, PDF, EPS, ...)
* Multiple concurrent clients
* For developers:
  * HTML/JavaScript client (TypeScript module)
  * Stateless asynchronous HTTP/WebSocket API
  

## Demo

![demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33600480/113182768-92eeda80-9253-11eb-9505-79de107024f7.gif)

## Installation

Install `httpgd` from CRAN:

```R
install.packages("httpgd")
```

Or get the latest development version from GitHub:

```R
devtools::install_github("nx10/httpgd")
```

See [system requirements](#System-requirements) for troubleshooting.

## Usage

Initialize graphics device and start server with:

```R
hgd()
```

Copy the displayed link in the browser or call

```R
hgd_browse()
```

to open a browser window automatically.

Plot anything.

```R
x = seq(0, 3 * pi, by = 0.1)
plot(x, sin(x), type = "l")
```

Every plotting library will work.

```R
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) +
  geom_point()
```

Stop the server with:

```R
dev.off()
```

### API &amp; Documentation

The API documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/nx10/httpgd/blob/master/docs/api-documentation.md), and is also available as a package vignette.

Technical documentation for developers wanting to contribute to `httpgd` can be found [here](https://github.com/nx10/httpgd/blob/master/docs/tecdoc.md).

## Benchmark

There are currently no other network graphics devices for comparison, `httpgd` can be used in offline mode (with `hgd(webserver = FALSE)`) to compare it with conventional SVG graphics devices.

This benchmark compares `httpgd` 1.1.0 with `svglite` 2.0.0.

[See benchmark code](https://github.com/nx10/httpgd/blob/master/docs/benchmark.R)


## System requirements

Depends on `R` version &geq; 4.0 on windows, and R &geq; 3.2 on linux and macOS (a C++ compiler with basic C++17 support [is required](https://github.com/nx10/httpgd/issues/56)).

Note that there is a rare bug in R versions < 4.1, that leads to [some plots disappearing when ggplot2 plots are resized and deleted in a specific way](https://github.com/nx10/httpgd/issues/50).

`libpng` and X11 are required on unix like systems (e.g. Linux, macOS).

### macOS

If `libpng` is missing install it via:

```sh
brew install libpng
```

If `X11` is missing the error message will include the text:

```sh
unable to load shared object [...] systemfonts/libs/systemfonts.so [...]
```

Install [`XQuartz`](https://www.xquartz.org/).
(see: <https://github.com/r-lib/systemfonts/issues/17>)

## Help welcome!

The various components of `httpgd` are written in C++, R and TypeScript. We welcome contributions of any kind.

Other areas in need of improvement are: Testing, documentation, net security and continuous integration.

If you feel lost, the [documentation](#api--documentation) might help.
