A graphics device for R that is accessible via network protocols.
This package was created to make it easier to embed live R graphics in 
integrated development environments and other applications.
The included HTML/JavaScript client (plot viewer) aims to provide a better overall user experience when dealing with R graphics.
The device asynchronously serves SVG graphics via HTTP and WebSockets.

## Features

* Fast high quality SVG plots
* Stateless asynchronous HTTP/WebSocket API
* Plot resizing
* Plot history
* HTML/JavaScript client (TypeScript module)
* Multiple concurrent clients

## Demo

![demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33600480/83944385-6587fa80-a803-11ea-8f4a-7808d144309d.gif)

## Installation

```R
devtools::install_github("nx10/httpgd")
```

See [system requirements](#System-requirements) for troubleshooting.

## Usage

Initialize graphics device and start server with:

```R
hgd()
```

Copy the displayed link in the browser or call

```R
hgd_browse()
```

to open a browser window automatically.

Plot anything.

```R
x = seq(0, 3 * pi, by = 0.1)
plot(x, sin(x), type = "l")
```

Every plotting library will work.

```R
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) +
  geom_point()
```

Stop the server with:

```R
dev.off()
```

### API &amp; Documentation

`httpgd` can be accessed both from R and from HTTP:

* [R API](https://github.com/nx10/httpgd/blob/master/docs/RApi.md)
* [Web API](https://github.com/nx10/httpgd/blob/master/docs/WebApi.md)

Technical documentation for developers wanting to contribute can be found [here](https://github.com/nx10/httpgd/blob/master/docs/tecdoc.md).

## Benchmark

There are currently no other network graphics devices for comparison, `httpgd` can be used in offline mode (with `hgd(webserver = FALSE)`) to compare it with conventional SVG graphics devices.

The [benchmark from svglite](https://github.com/r-lib/svglite/blob/master/README.md) has the following results:

svglite_test <- function() {
  svglite(tmp1)
  plot(x, y)

  plot(x, y)
  hgd_svg(file = tmp3)

}

## System requirements

Depends on `R` version &geq; 4.0.

`libpng` and X11 are required on unix like systems (e.g. Linux, macOS).

### macOS

If `libpng` is missing install it via:

```sh
brew install libpng
```

If `X11` is missing the error message will include the text:

```sh
unable to load shared object [...] systemfonts/libs/systemfonts.so [...]
```

Install [`XQuartz`](https://www.xquartz.org/).
(see: <https://github.com/r-lib/systemfonts/issues/17>)

## Help welcome!

The various components of `httpgd` are written in C++, R and TypeScript. We welcome contributions of any kind.

Other areas in need of improvement are: Testing, documentation, net security and continuous integration.

If you feel lost, the [technical documentation](https://github.com/nx10/httpgd/blob/master/docs/tecdoc.md) might help.
