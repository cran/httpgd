A graphics device for R that is accessible via network protocols.
This package was created to make it easier to embed live R graphics in 
integrated development environments and other applications.
The included HTML/JavaScript client (plot viewer) aims to provide a better overall user experience when dealing with R graphics.
The device asynchronously serves graphics via HTTP and WebSockets.

## Features

* Fast plotting
* Interactive plot viewer (client)
* Supports multiple clients concurrently
* Plot resizing and history
* Export various image formats (SVG, PNG, PDF, EPS, ...)
* Powered by [`unigd`](https://github.com/nx10/unigd)
* For developers:
  * Stateless asynchronous HTTP/WebSocket API
  * HTML/JavaScript client (TypeScript module)
